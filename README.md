# Motion parallax

This program that displays a landscape in a graphical canvas and allows the user to control the perspective of the landscape by moving the mouse. The perspective seems to change due to an effect called motion parallax. The program generates a gif. 

This code shows my abilites to use graphic packages and create visual representations.
